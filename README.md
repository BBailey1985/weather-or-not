# weather-or-not

This is a weather app that will tell you what you want to know about the weather in any city.

When you type in a city and hit the search button,
You are the shown:
- The city name and date
- An icon representing the current weather
- Temperature
- Humidity
- Wind Speed
- The UV index with a color code (Green is 2 or less, Yellow is from 2-5, and Red is over 5)
- A five day forecast

As you search for cities, the cities will populate in a list below the search box.
When you click on a previously searched city, the weather information will repopulate.

I hope you enjoy this app!
